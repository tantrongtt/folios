Here are 5 principles we use to feature portfolios:

##### 1. Aesthetic pleasing

Ensure your portfolio a visually stunning designs and layouts that captivate the audience.

##### 2. Case studies included

Share your design journey. Walk us through your projects with concise case studies that highlight challenges, solutions, and impact.

##### 3. No sub-domain

Keep it pro. Choose a custom domain instead of sub-domains like yourname.framer.com to to show a polished image.

##### 4. More personality, higher chance

Let your uniqueness shine. Inject personality into your portfolio — share insights, side project, or anything that makes you, well, you!

##### 5. Fast loading time

Speed matters. Ensure your portfolio loads like lightning for a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience.
