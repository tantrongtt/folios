Hey there,

You are seeking a new job, finding new clients or just starting our of school, you need a solid portfolio. That’s an obligation in design. You’ve worked on some cool projects, some are real, some are just your side projects. You want to bring it to your portoflio but you don’t know how a good portfolio looks like, and how to write a good case study for your project. There’s no surprise: you spend unlimited amount of time to finding inspiration from other good designers. It’s painful.

I know what it’s like back 2 years ago, when I wanted to move to Singapore (from Vietnam) and applied for a new design job. I spent lots of time on reseaching how a good design portfolio look like and how to write a good case study. That process is painful. But when you find the right inspiration, things will get easier.

That’s why I spent all my free time finding inspiring portfolios and good case studies then bookmarked everything to my list. And now, I share it with you. So when you build an design portfolio, you will have a place to start with.

Doing research in very important step when designing anything. With this curated collection and guide, you’ll get more time to forcus on designing your awesome portfolio and writing good case studies. And hopefully, you will get your dream jobs and clients.

Sincerely,

Trong, the guy behind Afolio
