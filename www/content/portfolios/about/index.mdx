Hey friends ðŸ¤˜,

Thanks for dropping here, it means youâ€™re kind of interested in this website and want to know more about it.

If you are seeking a new job, finding new clients, or just starting our of school, you need a solid portfolio. Thatâ€™s an obligation in design. You want to bring your cool projects to your portfolio but you donâ€™t know how a good portfolio looks like, and how to write a good case study. Thereâ€™s no surprise: you spend an unlimited amount of time to finding inspiration from other good designers. Itâ€™s painful.

I know what itâ€™s like back to 2 years ago when I wanted to move to Singapore (from Vietnam) and applied for a new design job. I spent lots of time researching. That process was painful for me too. But when I found the right inspirations, things got easier.

I spent all my free time finding inspiring portfolios and good case studies then bookmarked everything to my list. Then I can learn from it. Thatâ€™s why I made this site to share it with you. So when you build a design portfolio, you will have a place to start with.

Researching is a very important step when designing anything. With these curated collections and guides, youâ€™ll get more time to focus on designing your awesome portfolio and writing good case studies. And hopefully, you will get your dream jobs and clients.

Sincerely,

-[Trong](https://trongnguyen.co), the guy behind [Pafolios](https://twitter.com/pafolios)
