Hey ðŸ¤˜,

Thanks for dropping here, it means youâ€™re kind of interested in this website, and want to know more about it.

If you are seeking a new job, finding new clients or just starting our of school, you need a solid portfolio. Thatâ€™s an obligation in design. Youâ€™ve worked on some cool projects, some are real, some are just your side projects. You want to bring it to your portoflio but you donâ€™t know how a good portfolio looks like, and how to write a good case study for your project. Thereâ€™s no surprise: you spend unlimited amount of time to finding inspiration from other good designers. Itâ€™s painful.

I know what itâ€™s like back 2 years ago, when I wanted to move to Singapore (from Vietnam) and applied for a new design job. I spent lots of time on reseaching. That process is painful. But when you find the right inspiration, things will get easier.

Thatâ€™s why I spent all my free time finding inspiring portfolios and good case studies then bookmarked everything to my list. And now, I share it with you. So when you build an design portfolio, you will have a place to start with.

Doing research in very important step when designing anything. With this curated collection and guide, youâ€™ll get more time to forcus on designing your awesome portfolio and writing good case studies. And hopefully, you will get your dream jobs and clients.

Sincerely,

-[Trong](https://trongnguyen.co), the guy behind [@Afolio](https://twitter.com/trongawesome)
