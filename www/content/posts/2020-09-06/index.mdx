excerpt: Not only does Luca ace his project writeups, showcase incredible visual design, and apparently look the part (tattoo sleeve and gray hipster beanie? Hellooo, designer!), he also demonstrates the power of specialization. From the front page to project writeups, he talks about his unique process, always working in quick sprints validated by real user testing.
